Book REST API (Node.js & Express)
This project provides a simple RESTful API for managing a list of books. It uses Node.js and the Express.js framework. The book data is stored in-memory, meaning it will reset every time the server is restarted.

Features
GET /books: Retrieve all books.

GET /books/:id: Retrieve a single book by its ID.

POST /books: Add a new book.

PUT /books/:id: Update an existing book by its ID.

DELETE /books/:id: Remove a book by its ID.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js: Includes npm (Node Package Manager). Download it from https://nodejs.org/.

Setup and Installation
Clone the repository (or create the files manually):
If you're starting from scratch, create a new folder (e.g., book-api) and place the server.js file (provided in the Canvas) inside it.

Initialize Node.js Project:
Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project folder (cd book-api), and run the following command:

npm init -y

This command initializes a new Node.js project and creates a package.json file.

Install Dependencies:
Install the Express.js framework:

npm install express

Running the Server
To start the API server, run the following command from your project directory:

node server.js

You should see output similar to this, indicating the server is running:

Server is running on http://localhost:3000
Use Postman or curl to test the endpoints:
  GET all books: GET http://localhost:3000/books
  GET book by ID: GET http://localhost:3000/books/1
  POST new book: POST http://localhost:3000/books
    Body: {"title": "New Book", "author": "New Author"}
  PUT update book: PUT http://localhost:3000/books/1
    Body: {"title": "Updated Title"}
  DELETE book by ID: DELETE http://localhost:3000/books/1

The API will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

Next Steps (Potential Enhancements)
Persistent Storage: Integrate a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite) to store book data persistently instead of in-memory.

Error Handling: Implement more robust error handling and custom error middleware.

Validation: Add more comprehensive input validation (e.g., using libraries like joi or express-validator).

Authentication & Authorization: Secure the API with authentication (e.g., JWT) and authorization mechanisms.

Logging: Implement a logging library (e.g., morgan, winston) for better request logging.

Environment Variables: Use environment variables for sensitive information like port numbers or database connection strings.
